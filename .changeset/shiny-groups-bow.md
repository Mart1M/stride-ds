- **Dialog Component**: Modal system with DialogTrigger, DialogOverlay, DialogHeader, DialogBody, DialogFooter, and DialogClose. Features smooth animations, keyboard navigation, and size variants (sm through 7xl, full).
- **Animations**: Added CSS keyframes for modal overlays and content transitions using React Aria data attributes.
